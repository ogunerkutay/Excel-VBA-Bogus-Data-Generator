# Excel-VBA-Bogus-Data-Generator
This repository contains a simple yet powerful Excel VBA script designed to generate bogus (dummy) data in an Excel worksheet. The primary purpose of this script is to facilitate testing and development processes where realistic data structures are required, but actual data is not available or cannot be used due to privacy or security concerns.

# Features
Data Types: The script can generate a variety of data types including text, numbers, dates, and boolean values.
Customizable: You can specify the number of rows and columns of data you need, as well as the data types for each column.
Randomization: The generated data is completely random, ensuring a diverse dataset for robust testing.
Ease of Use: Simply run the script, input your specifications, and your Excel Worksheet 1 will be populated with the dummy data.
Compatibility: Works with all modern versions of Microsoft Excel that support VBA (Excel 2007 and later).
# Usage
Open your Excel workbook and press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor.
Import the provided VBA script into the editor.
Run the script, and when prompted, input the number of rows and columns you need, as well as the data types for each column.
Click 'Generate' and the script will populate Worksheet 1 with the specified bogus data.
Please note that this is a tool for development and testing purposes only. The generated data is completely fictitious and any resemblance to real persons or entities is purely coincidental.
